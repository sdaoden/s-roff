====================

The complete changelog of commits in between two versions can be
inspected by using the git(1) "log" command as shown below, where "OLD"
and "NEW" are the two versions to be compared, e.g., v2.0 and v2.1:

  # All commits:
  $ git log --reverse --topo-order --abbrev-commit OLD..NEW
  # Only topic branch headers (--no-merges for content commits only):
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges OLD..NEW
  # Same, but truly accessible:
  $ git log --oneline --reverse --topo-order --merges --parents OLD..NEW |
    while read c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6; do
      printf "%-24s: \$ git log --oneline --no-merges ${c1} ^${c2}\n" "${c6}";
    done

v2.0.0, 20??-??-??
