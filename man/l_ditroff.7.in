.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.
The name
.I ditroff
once marked a development level of the
.I troff
text processing system.
.
In actual
.BR @L_ROFF@-history (@MAN7EXT@)
systems, the name
.I troff
is used as a synonym for
.IR ditroff .
.
.P
The first roff system was written by Joe Ossanna around 1973.
.
It supported only two output devices, the
.B nroff
program produced text oriented tty output, while the
.B troff
program generated graphical output for exactly one output device, the Wang
.I Graphic Systems CAT
typesetter.
.
.P
In 1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote troff to support more devices by
creating an intermediate output format for troff that can be fed into
postprocessor programs which actually do the printout on the device.
.
Kernighan's version marks what is known as
.I classical troff
today.
.
In order to distinguish it from Ossanna's original mono-device version,
it was called
.I ditroff
.RI ( d "evice " i "ndependent " troff )
on some systems, though this naming isn't mentioned in the classical
documentation.
.
.P
Today, any existing roff system is based on Kernighan's multi-device
troff.
.
The distinction between
.I troff
and
.I ditroff
isn't necessary any longer, for each modern
.I troff
provides already the complete functionality of
.IR ditroff .
.
On most systems, the name
.I troff
is used to denote
.IR ditroff .
.
.P
The easiest way to use ditroff is
.BR @L_ROFF@ (@MAN1EXT@),
a wrapper around
.I (di)troff
that automatically handles postprocessing.
