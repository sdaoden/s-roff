.SH NAME
@L_D_TTY@ \- @T_ROFF@ driver for typewriter-like devices
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @L_D_TTY@
[
.B \-bBcdfhioruUv
] [
.BI \-F dir
] [
.IR files \|.\|.\|.\&
]
.PP
It is possible to have whitespace between the
.B \-F
option and its parameter.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B @L_D_TTY@
translates the output of
.B @L_TROFF@
into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices.
Normally
.B @L_D_TTY@
should be invoked by using the
.B @L_ROFF@
command
with a
.BR \-Tascii ,
.B \-Tlatin1
or
.B \-Tutf8
option on ASCII based systems, and with
.B \-Tcp1047
and
.B \-Tutf8
on EBCDIC based hosts.
If no files are given,
.B @L_D_TTY@
reads the standard input.
A filename of
.B \-
also causes usage of standard input.
Output is written to the standard output.
.
.LP
By default SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429, also called ANSI color
escapes) are emitted to change text attributes (bold, italic, colors).
This makes it possible to have eight different background and
foreground colors; additionally, bold and italic
attributes can be used \f[BI]at the same time\f[] (by using the BI font).
.
.LP
The following colors are defined in
.BR tty.tmac :
black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan.
Unknown colors are mapped to the default color (which is dependent on the
settings of the terminal; in most cases, this is black for the foreground
and white for the background).
.
.LP
Use the
.B \-c
switch to revert to the old behaviour, printing a bold character
.I c
with the sequence
.RI ` c
.SM BACKSPACE
.IR c '
and an italic character
.I c
by the sequence
.RB ` _
.SM BACKSPACE
.IR c '.
At the same time, color output is disabled.
The same effect can be achieved by setting either the
.B @U_ROFF_NO_SGR@
environment variable or using the `sgr' X command (see below).
.
.LP
For SGR support, it is necessary to use the
.B \-R
option of
.BR less (1)
to disable the interpretation of the old output format.
Consequently, all programs which use
.B less
as the pager program have to pass this option to it.
.
.LP
The old output format can be displayed on a terminal
by piping through
.BR ul (1).
Pagers such as
.BR more (1)
or
.BR less (1)
are also able to display these sequences.
Use either
.B \-B
or
.B \-U
when piping into
.BR less (1);
use
.B \-b
when piping into
.BR more (1).
There is no need to filter the output through
.BR col (1)
since
.B @L_D_TTY@
never outputs reverse line feeds.
.
.LP
The font description file may contain a command
.
.IP
.BI internalname\  n
.LP
.
where
.I n
is a decimal integer.
If the 01 bit in
.I n
is set,
then the font is treated as an italic font;
if the 02 bit is set,
then it is treated as a bold font.
The code field in the font description field gives the
code which is used to output the character.
This code can also be used in the
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence in
.BR troff .
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-b
Suppress the use of overstriking for bold characters.
Ignored if
.B \-c
isn't used.
.
.TP
.B \-B
Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.
Ignored if
.B \-c
isn't used.
.
.TP
.B \-c
Use the old output format (see above).
This also disables color output.
.
.TP
.B \-d
Ignore all
.B \[rs]D
commands.
Without this
.B \[rs]D'l\|.\|.\|.\&'
commands that have at least one zero argument
(and so are either horizontal or vertical)
are rendered using
.BR \- ,
.BR | ,
and
.B +
characters.
In a similar way
.B \[rs]D'p\|.\|.\|.\&'
commands are handled which consist entirely of horizontal and vertical
lines.
.
.
.TP
.B \-f
Use form feeds in the output.
A form feed is output at the end of each page that has no output
on its last line.
.
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Prepend directory
.IB dir /dev name
to the search path for font and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR ascii ,
.BR latin1 ,
.BR utf8 ,
or
.BR cp1047 .
.
.TP
.B \-h
Use horizontal tabs in the output.
Tabs are assumed to be set every 8 columns.
.
.TP
.B \-i
Use escape sequences to set the italic text attribute instead of the
underline attribute for italic fonts (`I' and `BI').
Note that most terminals (including xterm) don't support this.
Ignored if
.B \-c
is active.
.
.TP
.B \-o
Suppress overstriking (other than for bold or underlined characters in
case the old output format has been activated with
.BR \-c ).
.
.TP
.B \-r
Use escape sequences to set the reverse text attribute instead of the
underline attribute for italic fonts (`I' and `BI').
Ignored if
.B \-c
is active.
.
.TP
.B \-u
Suppress the use of underlining for italic characters.
Ignored if
.B \-c
isn't used.
.
.TP
.B \-U
Use only underlining for bold-italic characters.
Ignored if
.B \-c
isn't used.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.
.
.SH USAGE
.
.B @L_D_TTY@
understands a single X command produced using the
.B \[rs]X
escape sequence.
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'tty:\ sgr\  n '
If
.I n
is non-zero or missing, enable SGR output (this is the default), otherwise
use the old drawing scheme for bold and underline.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.
.TP
.SM
.B @U_ROFF_NO_SGR@
If set, the old drawing scheme for bold and underline (using the
backspace character) is active.
Colors are disabled.
.
.
.TP
.SM
.B @U_ROFF_FONT_PATH@
A list of directories in which to search for the
.BI dev name
directory in addition to the default ones.
.
See
.BR @L_TROFF@ (@MAN1EXT@)
and
.BR \%@L_ROFF@-font (@MAN5EXT@)
for more details.

.
.
.SH BUGS
.
.LP
.B @L_D_TTY@
is intended only for simple documents.
.
.LP
There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical motions.
.
.LP
There is no support for
.B \[rs]D
commands
other than horizontal and vertical lines.
.
.LP
Characters above the first line (ie with a vertical position of\~0)
cannot be printed.
.
.LP
Color handling is different compared to
.BR @L_D_PS@ (@MAN1EXT@).
.B \[rs]M
doesn't set the fill color for closed graphic objects (which
.B @L_D_TTY@
doesn't support anyway) but changes the background color of the character
cell, affecting all subsequent operations.
