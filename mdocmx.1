.Sh NAME
.Nm .Mx
.Nd Is an extension to the mdoc semantic markup language
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar -enable
.Pp
.Nm
.Nm
.Ar *DIGITS
.Nm
.Ar macro
.Nm
.Ar macro Ar key

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
introduces creation of referenceable manual index anchors.
To enable this extension the standard
.Xr mdoc 7
document prologue \(en
.Ic \&Dd ,
.Ic \&Dt
and
.Ic \&Os
\(en is augmented with the new command
.Nm
.Ar -enable .
Because macros driven by single-pass troff implementations cannot
create backward references
.Xr mdoc 7
documents which use this extension need to be preprocessed with the
.Xr mdocmx 1
preprocessor, which is a regular part of
.Xr mdocmx 7
and implemented in portable
.Xr awk 1 .
Specialized manual formatters and macros driven by multi-pass troff
interpreters may not require a preprocessor to support this extension.
.Pp
.Em Remarks:
The
.Nm
request cannot share a line with other macros, neither in the document
prologue nor in its content.
It may be helpful to enable messages of the
.Xr mdocmx 1
preprocessor on standard error when writing a manual \(en a value of `1'
will give only warnings, any greater value will increase verbosity:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mdocmx.awk -v VERBOSE=2 < mdocmx.7 2> stderr.txt | \e
  groff -Tascii -mdoc | less
$ cat stderr.txt
.Ed
.Pp
After the extension was
.Ar -enable Ns
d in the document prologue the other
.Nm
usage forms can be used to enqueue index anchor requests.
These requests form a stack which will be consumed (popped) by the
later occurrence of a (corresponding)
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ar macro
which supports referenceable index entries.
The indices are managed with distinct namespaces for each supported
.Ar macro ,
meaning that, e.g., `\&.Mx \&.Ic sendmail' and `\&.Mx \&.Va sendmail'
will create distinct index anchors.
.Pp
Using the plain macro
.Nm
without arguments creates a stack entry for which both,
the name of the
.Ar macro
as well as the
.Ar key
will be taken from the document content.
.Nm
.Ar macro
will create a stack entry that will be consumed by the next occurrence of
.Ar macro
only, then taking the
.Ar key
off the document content, whereas
.Nm
.Ar macro Ar key
creates a stack entry that also has its
.Ar key
defined, and which will be consumed once an exactly matching macro / key
pair is seen in the document only.
(The
.Sx EXAMPLES
section gives a use case for this usage form.)
.Nm
.Ar *DIGITS
is a special form of the anonymous plain
.Nm
that creates `DIGITS' stack entries with one command.
The following macros support referenceable anchors via
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width ".It Ic .Dv"
.Mx *8
.It Ic .Ar
Command argument.
.It Ic .Cm
Command modifier.
.It Ic .Dv
Defined variable or preprocessor constant.
.It Ic .Er
Error constant.
.It Ic .Ev
Environment variable.
.It Ic .Fl
Command line option (flag).
.It Ic .Fn
Function name.
.It Ic .Fo
Function name (in function block syntax).
This is mapped to
.Ic .Fn ,
.Ic .Fo
has no index by itself.
.Mx
.It Ic .Ic
Internal or interactive command.
.Mx
.It Ic .Pa
File system path.
.Mx
.It Ic .Va
Variable name.
.El
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A complete, but completely fanciful
.Xr mdoc 7
document that uses the
.Xr mdocmx 7
extension would for example be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\&.Dd November 4, 2014
\&.Dt MDOCMX-EXAMPLE 7
\&.Os
\&.Mx -enable
\&.Bl -tag -width ".It Fn _atexit"
\&.Mx *3
\&.It Ic .Ar
This will create an anchor for a macro `Ic', key `.Ar'.
\&.It Ic .Cm
Anchor for `Ic', key `.Cm'.
\&.It Ic .Dv
And an anchor for `Ic', key `.Dv'.
\&.Mx Ic
\&.Mx Ic "final anchor"
\&.Mx Fn _atexit
\&.It Fn exit
No anchor here.
\&.It Fn at_quick_exit , Fn _atexit
Not for the first, but for the second `Fn' there will be an
anchor with the key `_atexit'.
Note that whitespace is important and may (dependend on the
formatter) be normalized to a single ASCII space character.
With `VERBOSE=1' or higher a warning is issued in such cases.
\&.It Ic "no anchor here"
\&.It Ic "final anchor"
Pops the pushed `Ic' / `final anchor' macro / key pair.
\&.It Ic ciao
Pops the `Ic' and assigns the key `Ciao'.
